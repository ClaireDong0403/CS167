(Q1) What do you think the line job.setJarByClass(Filter.class); does? <\br>
I think by using this setJarByClass method we tell Hadoop to find out the relevant jar by finding out that the class specified as it's parameter to be present as part of that jar. 
Here we help Hadoop to find out that which jar it should send to nodes to perform Map and Reduce tasks.
