* (Q2).Record the running time of the copy command.

* (Q3).How do the two numbers compare?\br
Using file system command is faster than running the jar file. I think it is because the file system has some optimization on the operation but the java file I wrote doesn't.

* (Q4).Does the program run after you change the default file system to HDFS? What is the error message, if any, that you get?
It is because the default path is HDFS. I don't have the file in hdfs.

* (Q5).
